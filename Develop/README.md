# Homework_SWN_Editing
Editing existing code to make it more accessible and easier for the client to read and edit later.
Cutting down on filler within the code to make it more readable and easier for future editors.

This project is about me learning to edit and update an existing website to make it more semantic and easier to read / edit.
